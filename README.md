# WavGoodnight2Me

This repo was originally intended as a place for me to experiment with the creation and manipulation of wav files with python/numpy. `
Currently it contains just one working program called "morse.py" which takes an input string and creates a morse code WAV file out of it, and then plays the file. The created file will be called "morse.wav".

## Usage:
Just run the file with the only argument being the string you want to convert to morse code. if you want to stop listening to the morse code early simply press enter

Example: python3 morse.py "string to turn into morse code"

If no string is given it will create morse code for the string "SOS"
